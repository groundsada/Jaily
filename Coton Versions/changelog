___________________________________________________-
v14

This version supports the following new instructions:
- "tstmp" stores timestamp in A
- "redim a" redimensions the packet according to the value in the accumulator (in case you want to shorten or enlarge the packet, this wasn't previously possible).
- "cbo" and "cboh" to change byte order in A, for 4 octets or the lowest 2 octets repsectively.
- "ococs16 a" -- will calculate "IP checksum" (also used for TCP and UDP) starting at packet[X] and for length A and store the result in A.

All other behaviour should be unchanged from the previous version of the
toolchain.

Since there are new instructions, we might need to go through a couple of
iterations to ensure that the behaviour is implemented correctly, and
I've added warnings when these instructions appear in the BPF code.
